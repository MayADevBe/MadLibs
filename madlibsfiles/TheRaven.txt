Once upon a adverb dreary, while I pondered, weak and adjective,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten noun -
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a verb,
As of some one gently verb, verb at my noun.
"'Tis some visiter," I muttered, "verb at my noun -
            Only this and nothing more."
(- Original Edgar Allan Poe)
