Alice was beginning to get adverb tired of verbing by her sister on the bank,
and of having nothing to do: once or twice she looked at the noun her sister was looking at,
but it had no pictures or conversations,
"and what is the use of a noun," thought Alice adjective, "without pictures or conversations?"
